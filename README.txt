VLSI Floorplan

The goal of this program is to optimize a partitioned circuit modules into a
rectangular chip to optimize a predefined cost metric such as area; it is
particularly crucial because the resulting floorplan affects all the subsequent
steps in physical design, such as cell placement, wire routing, and so on.
This program implements a floorplanner that layouts a set of
rectangular modules and optimizes the packing area.


To compile the code, use the following command:
make floorplanner
